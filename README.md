Building models using teachable machines for Deep Learning


1. No code models
   Image: Animal image model
   Pose: Yoga pose model
   Audio: Guitar audio model

The first two models can be run using a local python server in the browser, the audio model must run in the teachable machine site.

2. On device models with no customization

3. Custom model training blackbox way using transfer learning with mlkit

4. Custom classifier with keras models

5. Custom classifier deployed on web

6. Embedding based ml app deployed on phone
