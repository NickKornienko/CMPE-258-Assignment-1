Building models using teachable machines for Deep Learning

1. No code models
   Image: Animal image model
   Pose: Yoga pose model
   Audio: Guitar audio model (must be run in browser)

2. On device models with no customization:
   - MediaPipe-Demo.ipynb (using Face_images)

3. Custom model training blackbox way using transfer learning with mlkit (AutoML)

4. Custom classifier with keras models
   - Flower-recognizer-Keras.ipynb (using https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset)

5. Custom classifier
   - Comment_Classifier.ipynb

6. Embedding based ml app
   - Product-Search-Embeddings.ipynb (using marketing_sample_for_amazon_com-ecommerce__20200101_20200131__10k_data.csv)
