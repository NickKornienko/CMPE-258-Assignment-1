# CMPE-258-Assignment-1
Building models using teachable machines for Deep Learning

1. No code models
   Image: Animal image model
   Pose: Yoga pose model
   Audio: Guitar audio model

The first two models can be run using a local python server in the browser, the audio model must run in the teachable machine site.

2. On device models with no customization:
   - MediaPipe-Demo.ipynb (using Face_images)

3. Custom model training blackbox way using transfer learning with mlkit (AutoML)

4. Custom classifier with keras models
   - Flower-recognizer-Keras.ipynb (using [flower_images.zip](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset))

6. Custom classifier deployed on web

7. Embedding based ml app deployed on phone
